Model description       : 

        "The Demoness is a unique creature--the only one of her kind.
        Through powerful wizardry she was created by Eidolon as the
        first of a new race of magic-wielding minions.  The Demoness
        was to be the mother of her kind, but the Serpent Rider never
        had the opportunity to complete his work."
                                        -- The Portals of Praevus Manual


Other info              : 
        TRIS INFO:
	There are some minor cosmetic changes and bug fixes that I did to the
	model and I made some new frames for the Q2 native animations.  Nothing fancy,
	but I hate ppm's that don't have wave animations, so I went and quickly did a few.	
	The original weapon model I used for the main vwep aligning was
        somewhat corrupted (see weaponorg.md2+pcx), therefore some of
        the vweps have a slightly "wobbly" look to them, but this is only 
	noticable when looking at the stand animation.  Sorry, but the only 
	way to fix this is to do a manual re-align of every frame.
	
	VWEP INFO:
	The viewable weapons included in this model are all based on Hexen2 and/or
	H2:PoP designs and ideas and Raven retains all copyrights to the models,
	skins and their likenesses.
	You might notice how the vweps use a somewhat less than generic skin-
	naming scheme, but this is purposely done to allow interchanging of vwep
	md2's.  (ex. want the Purifier to be the Hyperblaster instead of the
	Railgun?  just rename w_railgun.md2 to w_hyperblaster.md2.  you don't have to
	worry about renaming the skins this way)

	VWEP KEY (default):
	Blaster 	= Sickle
	Shotgun		= Crossbow
	SuperShotgun	= MeteorStaff
	Machinegun	= SaphireWand
	Chaingun	= TempestStaff
	Grenadelauncher	= ScarabStaff
	RocketLauncher	= RavenStaff
	Hyperblaster	= SunStaff	
	Railgun		= Purifier
	BFG10K		= Wings of the Fallen Angel ;)
	XATRIX:
	IonRipper	= Staff of Ra
	PhalanxCannon	= Staff of Anubis
	
	The following aren't activated by default but may be used to substitute any weapon:
	Weapon.md2 (TempestStaff hilt)
	Weaponorg.md2 (original H2 weapon (TempestStaff))
	Icemace.md2 and Firemace.md2 (two weapon alternatives but they wobble alot :( )

	I might add ROGUE vwep support but nobody seems to play it anymore, and now with
	Quake3Arena finally out I'm probably gonna concentrate mainly on the Q3 modeling scene.

Known Bugs              : A little vwep "wobbling" during some frames, some
                          wasted skin space (I didn't feel like remapping the skin. 
			  It looks fine), and interpolation causes some strange 
			  effects during the flip sequence, barely noticable though.

Build/Animation time    : hmm... I started it in July 99 but it has been sitting idle on my hardrive 
			  for awhile now.
